1 apparently reassembled from the cutting-room floor of any given daytime soap .

1 will undoubtedly play well in european markets , where mr. besson is a brand name , and in asia , where ms. shu is an institution , but american audiences will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic .
2 one of -lrb- jaglom 's -rrb- better efforts -- a wry and sometime bitter movie about love .

2 this is amusing for about three minutes .
3 though a touch too arthouse 101 in its poetic symbolism , heaven proves to be a good match of the sensibilities of two directors .
4 superbly photographed and staged by mendes with a series of riveting set pieces the likes of which mainstream audiences have rarely seen .
3 a metaphor for a modern-day urban china searching for its identity .
3 it 's a square , sentimental drama that satisfies , as comfort food often can .

3 ambitious , unsettling psychodrama that takes full , chilling advantage of its rough-around-the-edges , low-budget constraints .

1 if nothing else , `` rollerball '' 2002 may go down in cinema history as the only movie ever in which the rest of the cast was outshined by ll cool j.

3 -lrb- allen 's -rrb- best works understand why snobbery is a better satiric target than middle-america diversions could ever be .

3 though it goes further than both , anyone who has seen the hunger or cat people will find little new here , but a tasty performance from vincent gallo lifts this tale of cannibal lust above the ordinary .

4 features what is surely the funniest and most accurate depiction of writer 's block ever .
2 admirably ambitious but self-indulgent .
3 whenever it threatens to get bogged down in earnest dramaturgy , a stirring visual sequence like a surge through swirling rapids or a leap from pinnacle to pinnacle rouses us .

3 asks what truth can be discerned from non-firsthand experience , and specifically questions cinema 's capability for recording truth .
3 audiences are advised to sit near the back and squint to avoid noticing some truly egregious lip-non-synching , but otherwise the production is suitably elegant .

3 a formula family tearjerker told with a heavy irish brogue ... accentuating , rather than muting , the plot 's saccharine thrust .

0 a vile , incoherent mess ... a scummy ripoff of david cronenberg 's brilliant ` videodrome . '
3 discursive but oddly riveting documentary .
0 what 's most offensive is n't the waste of a good cast , but the film 's denial of sincere grief and mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism .

3 though it lacks the utter authority of a genre gem , there 's a certain robustness to this engaging mix of love and bloodletting .

0 this mess of a movie is nothing short of a travesty of a transvestite comedy .
1 a baffling subplot involving smuggling drugs inside danish cows falls flat , and if you 're going to alter the bard 's ending , you 'd better have a good alternative .
0 there 's surely something wrong with a comedy where the only belly laughs come from the selection of outtakes tacked onto the end credits .
3 no , it 's not as single-minded as john carpenter 's original , but it 's sure a lot smarter and more unnerving than the sequels .
2 the boys ' sparring , like the succession of blows dumped on guei , wears down the story 's more cerebral , and likable , plot elements .

3 i 'm guessing the director is a magician .
3 a dashing and absorbing outing with one of france 's most inventive directors .

4 a delightful entree in the tradition of food movies .
1 -lrb- johnnie to and wai ka fai are -rrb- sure to find an enthusiastic audience among american action-adventure buffs , but the film 's interests may be too narrow to attract crossover viewers .

1 it leers , offering next to little insight into its intriguing subject .
1 a pleasant and engaging enough sit , but in trying to have the best of both worlds it ends up falling short as a whole .
2 because eight legged freaks is partly an homage to them , tarantula and other low - budget b-movie thrillers of the 1950s and '60s , the movie is a silly -lrb- but not sophomoric -rrb- romp through horror and hellish conditions .

2 in moonlight mile , no one gets shut out of the hug cycle .
1 ararat feels like a book report
1 the beautiful images and solemn words can not disguise the slack complacency of -lrb- godard 's -rrb- vision , any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice .
4 tully is in many ways the perfect festival film : a calm , self-assured portrait of small town regret , love , duty and friendship that appeals to the storytelling instincts of a slightly more literate filmgoing audience .
1 it 's a shame the marvelous first 101 minutes have to be combined with the misconceived final 5 .
3 a surprisingly charming and even witty match for the best of hollywood 's comic-book adaptations .

2 ... a somber film , almost completely unrelieved by any comedy beyond the wistful everyday ironies of the working poor .
3 even if you 're an agnostic carnivore , you can enjoy much of jonah simply , and gratefully , as laugh-out-loud lunacy with a pronounced monty pythonesque flavor .
3 one of the best of a growing strain of daring films ... that argue that any sexual relationship that does n't hurt anyone and works for its participants is a relationship that is worthy of our respect .
1 set in a 1986 harlem that does n't look much like anywhere in new york .

1 they crush each other under cars , throw each other out windows , electrocute and dismember their victims in full consciousness .
2 with its hint of an awkward hitchcockian theme in tact , harmon 's daunting narrative promotes a reasonable landscape of conflict and pathos to support the scattershot terrorizing tone
4 in addition to scoring high for originality of plot -- putting together familiar themes of family , forgiveness and love in a new way -- lilo & stitch has a number of other assets to commend it to movie audiences both innocent and jaded .
4 perhaps it 's cliche to call the film ` refreshing , ' but it is .
0 as predictable as the outcome of a globetrotters-generals game , juwanna mann is even more ludicrous than you 'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre , and a personal low for everyone involved .
4 almodovar is an imaginative teacher of emotional intelligence in this engaging film about two men who discover what william james once called ` the gift of tears . '
4 a fantastically vital movie that manages to invest real humor , sensuality , and sympathy into a story about two adolescent boys .
0 ... the story is far-flung , illogical , and plain stupid .
3 and lee seems just as expectant of an adoring , wide-smiling reception .
1 it 's all arty and jazzy and people sit and stare and turn away from one another instead of talking and it 's all about the silences and if you 're into that , have at it .
3 an old-fashioned drama of substance about a teacher 's slide down the slippery slope of dishonesty after an encounter with the rich and the powerful who have nothing but disdain for virtue .
1 another useless recycling of a brutal mid - '70s american sports movie .
1 the kind of movie that leaves vague impressions and a nasty aftertaste but little clear memory of its operational mechanics .

3 as literary desecrations go , this makes for perfectly acceptable , occasionally very enjoyable children 's entertainment .
1 this insufferable movie is meant to make you think about existential suffering .
4 goofy , nutty , consistently funny .
1 two big things are missing -- anything approaching a visceral kick , and anything approaching even a vague reason to sit through it all .
4 if `` lilo & stitch '' is n't the most edgy piece of disney animation to hit the silver screen , then this first film to use a watercolor background since `` dumbo '' certainly ranks as the most original in years .
3 while it has definite weaknesses -- like a rather unbelievable love interest and a meandering ending -- this '60s caper film is a riveting , brisk delight .
3 it 's a talking head documentary , but a great one .
0 an extremely unpleasant film .
4 director juan jose campanella could have turned this into an argentine retread of `` iris '' or `` american beauty , '' but instead pulls a little from each film and creates something more beautiful than either of those films .
1 not good enough to pass for a litmus test of the generation gap and not bad enough to repulse any generation of its fans .
0 after seeing the film , i can tell you that there 's no other reason why anyone should bother remembering it .
2 an `` o bruin , where art thou ? ''
1 it stars schticky chris rock and stolid anthony hopkins , who seem barely in the same movie .
0 merely -lrb- and literally -rrb- tosses around sex toys and offers half-hearted paeans to empowerment that are repeatedly undercut by the brutality of the jokes , most at women 's expense .

4 enjoyably fast-moving , hard-hitting documentary .
3 if you come from a family that eats , meddles , argues , laughs , kibbitzes and fights together , then go see this delightful comedy .
1 the director mostly plays it straight , turning leys ' fable into a listless climb down the social ladder .
2 it will break your heart many times over .
1 millions of dollars heaped upon a project of such vast proportions need to reap more rewards than spiffy bluescreen technique and stylish weaponry .
1 any film that does n't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss .
1 it 's depressing to see how far herzog has fallen .
1 some episodes work , some do n't .
3 like its new england characters , most of whom wander about in thick clouds of denial , the movie eventually gets around to its real emotional business , striking deep chords of sadness .
1 all the more disquieting for its relatively gore-free allusions to the serial murders , but it falls down in its attempts to humanize its subject .
0 a film of empty , fetishistic violence in which murder is casual and fun .
3 for those in search of something different , wendigo is a genuinely bone-chilling tale .
2 a poorly scripted , preachy fable that forgets about unfolding a coherent , believable story in its zeal to spread propaganda .
2 about a boy vividly recalls the cary grant of room for one more , houseboat and father goose in its affectionate depiction of the gentle war between a reluctant , irresponsible man and the kid who latches onto him .
1 disappointing in comparison to other recent war movies ... or any other john woo flick for that matter .
2 it may not be `` last tango in paris '' but ...
3 it 's a familiar story , but one that is presented with great sympathy and intelligence .
3 becomes a fascinating study of isolation and frustration that successfully recreates both the physical setting and emotional tensions of the papin sisters .
3 murderous maids pulls no punches in its depiction of the lives of the papin sister and the events that led to their notorious rise to infamy ...
3 it 's not nearly as fresh or enjoyable as its predecessor , but there are enough high points to keep this from being a complete waste of time .

3 it 's a spectacular performance - ahem , we hope it 's only acting .
0 ... the film 's considered approach to its subject matter is too calm and thoughtful for agitprop , and the thinness of its characterizations makes it a failure as straight drama . '
2 harris is supposed to be the star of the story , but comes across as pretty dull and wooden .
3 symbolically , warm water under a red bridge is a celebration of feminine energy , a tribute to the power of women to heal .
2 they were right .

2 every child 's story is what matters .
2 there are far worse messages to teach a young audience , which will probably be perfectly happy with the sloppy slapstick comedy .
3 few films have captured the chaos of an urban conflagration with such fury , and audience members will leave feeling as shaken as nesbitt 's cooper looks when the bullets stop flying .
4 ferrara 's best film in years .
1 we have poignancy jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe , that it looks neat .

0 stitch is a bad mannered , ugly and destructive little \*\*\*\* .
2 alain choquart 's camera barely stops moving , portraying both the turmoil of the time and giving conduct a perpetual sense of urgency , which , for a film that takes nearly three hours to unspool , is both funny and irritating .
4 an intelligently made -lrb- and beautifully edited -rrb- picture that at the very least has a spark of life to it -- more than you can say for plenty of movies that flow through the hollywood pipeline without a hitch .
4 charlie hunnam has the twinkling eyes , repressed smile and determined face needed to carry out a dickensian hero .

3 a dreadful day in irish history is given passionate , if somewhat flawed , treatment .
1 the april 2002 instalment of the american war for independence , complete with loads of cgi and bushels of violence , but not a drop of human blood .
0 if there was any doubt that peter o'fallon did n't have an original bone in his body , a rumor of angels should dispel it .
1 there is something in full frontal , i guess , about artifice and acting and how it distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them , but like most movie riddles , it works only if you have an interest in the characters you see .

2 but i do .
1 lacks dramatic punch and depth .

2 who is this movie for ?
3 a great cast and a wonderful but sometimes confusing flashback movie about growing up in a dysfunctional family .
0 ozpetek offers an aids subtext , skims over the realities of gay sex , and presents yet another tired old vision of the gay community as an all-inclusive world where uptight , middle class bores like antonia can feel good about themselves .
0 the leads are so unmemorable , despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes , that one eventually resents having to inhale this gutter romancer 's secondhand material .
0 a relative letdown .
1 from its nauseating spinning credits sequence to a very talented but underutilized supporting cast , bartleby squanders as much as it gives out .

4 brings an irresistible blend of warmth and humor and a consistent embracing humanity in the face of life 's harshness .
1 inconsequential road-and-buddy pic .
2 with miscast leads , banal dialogue and an absurdly overblown climax , killing me softly belongs firmly in the so-bad-it 's - good camp .
0 it 's been 13 months and 295 preview screenings since i last walked out on a movie , but resident evil really earned my indignant , preemptive departure .
3 the leanest and meanest of solondz 's misanthropic comedies .
3 about schmidt belongs to nicholson .
3 its metaphors are opaque enough to avoid didacticism , and the film succeeds as an emotionally accessible , almost mystical work .
0 starts as an intense political and psychological thriller but is sabotaged by ticking time bombs and other hollywood-action cliches .
2 unspools like a highbrow , low-key , 102-minute infomercial , blending entrepreneurial zeal with the testimony of satisfied customers .
3 even if it pushes its agenda too forcefully , this remains a film about something , one that attempts and often achieves a level of connection and concern .
2 it 's a sight to behold .
2 the setting is so cool that it chills the characters , reducing our emotional stake in the outcome of `` intacto 's '' dangerous and seductively stylish game .
2 if you 're not totally weirded - out by the notion of cinema as community-therapy spectacle , quitting hits home with disorienting force .
2 better than the tepid star trek : insurrection ; falls short of first contact because the villain could n't pick the lint off borg queen alice krige 's cape ; and finishes half a parsec -lrb- a nose -rrb- ahead of generations .
2 at times the guys taps into some powerful emotions , but this kind of material is more effective on stage .
2 anyone else seen this before ?
1 the film is grossly contradictory in conveying its social message , if indeed there is one .
3 daringly perceptive , taut , piercing and feisty , biggie and tupac is undeniably subversive and involving in its bold presentation .
1 boyd 's screenplay -lrb- co-written with guardian hack nick davies -rrb- has a florid turn of phrase that owes more to guy ritchie than the bard of avon .

3 this deeply spiritual film taps into the meaning and consolation in afterlife communications .
3 i know that i 'll never listen to marvin gaye or the supremes the same way again
2 bearable .
1 a big , loud , bang-the-drum bore .

0 horrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it is n't incomprehensible .
0 after collateral damage , you might imagine that most every aggrieved father cliché has been unturned .
3 predictable storyline and by-the-book scripting is all but washed away by sumptuous ocean visuals and the cinematic stylings of director john stockwell .
4 laugh-out-loud lines , adorably ditsy but heartfelt performances , and sparkling , bittersweet dialogue that cuts to the chase of the modern girl 's dilemma .
3 essentially a collection of bits -- and they 're all naughty .
1 you get the impression that writer and director burr steers knows the territory ... but his sense of humor has yet to lose the smug self-satisfaction usually associated with the better private schools .

3 the viewer takes great pleasure in watching the resourceful molly stay a step ahead of her pursuers .

1 still , it just sits there like a side dish no one ordered .
2 wiser souls would have tactfully pretended not to see it and left it lying there

1 who , exactly , is fighting whom here ?
1 can be as tiresome as 9 seconds of jesse helms ' anti- castro rhetoric , which are included
1 it 's a lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character , especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as phoenix 's .
1 in truth , it has all the heart of a porno flick -lrb- but none of the sheer lust -rrb- .
1 cherish would 've worked a lot better had it been a short film .
2 sometimes shorter is better .
2 as schmidt , nicholson walks with a slow , deliberate gait , chooses his words carefully and subdues his natural exuberance .
3 if you 're looking for an intelligent movie in which you can release your pent up anger , enough is just the ticket you need .
2 hardly a nuanced portrait of a young woman 's breakdown , the film nevertheless works up a few scares .

1 a zippy 96 minutes of mediocre special effects , hoary dialogue , fluxing accents , and -- worst of all -- silly-looking morlocks .
1 every so often a film comes along that is so insanely stupid , so awful in so many ways that watching it leaves you giddy .
3 but it is entertaining on an inferior level .

2 the problems of the people in love in the time of money are hardly specific to their era .
2 the question hanging over the time machine is not , as the main character suggests , ` what if ? '
4 it 's a head-turner -- thoughtfully written , beautifully read and , finally , deeply humanizing .
0 as it is , it 's too long and unfocused .
1 this is not a classical dramatic animated feature , nor a hip , contemporary , in-jokey one .
3 i 'm not a fan of the phrase ` life affirming ' because it usually means ` schmaltzy , ' but real women have curves truly is life affirming .
1 too much of storytelling moves away from solondz 's social critique , casting its audience as that of intellectual lector in contemplation of the auteur 's professional injuries .
3 charlotte sometimes is a gem .
2 the movie , while beautiful , feels labored , with a hint of the writing exercise about it .
2 the symbols float like butterflies and the spinning styx sting like bees .
2 the result is more depressing than liberating , but it 's never boring .
3 australia : land beyond time is an enjoyable big movie primarily because australia is a weirdly beautiful place .
3 as immaculate as stuart little 2 is , it could be a lot better if it were , well , more adventurous .

3 while the material is slight , the movie is better than you might think .
2 meant for star wars fans .
2 the video work is so grainy and rough , so dependent on being ` naturalistic ' rather than carefully lit and set up , that it 's exhausting to watch .
1 unambitious writing emerges in the movie , using a plot that could have come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook .
3 the film 's strength is n't in its details , but in the larger picture it paints - of a culture in conflict with itself , with the thin veneer of nationalism that covers our deepest , media-soaked fears .
1 i do n't think most of the people who loved the 1989 paradiso will prefer this new version .
1 a sluggish pace and lack of genuine narrative hem the movie in every bit as much as life hems in the spirits of these young women .
1 broomfield 's style of journalism is hardly journalism at all , and even those with an avid interest in the subject will grow impatient .

2 quelle surprise !
3 a stirring road movie .
4 bursting through the constraints of its source , this is one adapted - from-television movie that actually looks as if it belongs on the big screen .
3 even with all its botches , enigma offers all the pleasure of a handsome and well-made entertainment .
1 the images lack contrast , are murky and are frequently too dark to be decipherable .

3 city by the sea is a gritty police thriller with all the dysfunctional family dynamics one could wish for .
0 dismally dull sci-fi comedy .

3 maybe he was reading the minds of the audience .
2 may seriously impair your ability to ever again maintain a straight face while speaking to a highway patrolman .
4 grenier is terrific , bringing an unforced , rapid-fire delivery to toback 's heidegger - and nietzsche-referencing dialogue .
0 burns ' fifth beer-soaked film feels in almost every possible way -- from the writing and direction to the soggy performances -- tossed off .
3 less the sensational true-crime hell-jaunt purists might like and more experimental in its storytelling -lrb- though no less horrifying for it -rrb- .
2 if reno is to the left of liberal on the political spectrum , her tough , funny , rather chaotic show is n't subversive so much as it is nit-picky about the hypocrisies of our time .
1 it 's not so much a movie as a joint promotion for the national basketball association and teenaged rap and adolescent poster-boy lil ' bow wow .
1 it labours as storytelling .
4 a first-class road movie that proves you can run away from home , but your ego and all your problems go with you .
2 maybe thomas wolfe was right : you ca n't go home again .
2 the plot 's clearly mythic structure may owe more to disney 's strong sense of formula than to the original story .

0 yes , i have given this movie a rating of zero .
3 a buoyant romantic comedy about friendship , love , and the truth that we 're all in this together .
3 the locations go from stark desert to gorgeous beaches .
1 an acceptable way to pass a little over an hour with moviegoers ages 8-10 , but it 's unlikely to inspire anything more than a visit to mcdonald 's , let alone some savvy street activism .
4 those who are n't put off by the film 's austerity will find it more than capable of rewarding them .

2 one of those staggeringly well-produced , joylessly extravagant pictures that keep whooshing you from one visual marvel to the next , hastily , emptily .
4 a funny and touching film that is gorgeously acted by a british cast to rival gosford park 's .

4 intriguing and downright intoxicating .
3 a sharp satire of desperation and cinematic deception .
3 i still like moonlight mile , better judgment be damned .

1 steve oedekerk is , alas , no woody allen .
3 george lucas returns as a visionary with a tale full of nuance and character dimension .
1 putting the primitive murderer inside a high-tech space station unleashes a pandora 's box of special effects that run the gamut from cheesy to cheesier to cheesiest .
0 with the cheesiest monsters this side of a horror spoof , which they is n't , it is more likely to induce sleep than fright .
1 though tom shadyac 's film kicks off spookily enough , around the halfway mark it takes an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and laughable contrivance .
3 `` auto focus '' works as an unusual biopic and document of male swingers in the playboy era
0 with jump cuts , fast editing and lots of pyrotechnics , yu clearly hopes to camouflage how bad his movie is .

2 not a bad premise , but the execution is lackluster at best .
4 insightfully written , delicately performed
1 shyamalan should stop trying to please his mom .
1 kung pow is oedekerk 's realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial-arts flick , and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that .
1 wimps out by going for that pg-13 rating , so the more graphic violence is mostly off-screen and the sexuality is muted .

3 the movie 's thesis -- elegant technology for the masses -- is surprisingly refreshing .

3 it has its faults , but it is a kind , unapologetic , sweetheart of a movie , and mandy moore leaves a positive impression .
1 a baffling mixed platter of gritty realism and magic realism with a hard-to-swallow premise .
1 the code talkers deserved better than a hollow tribute .
3 for proof of that on the cinematic front , look no further than this 20th anniversary edition of the film that spielberg calls , retrospectively , his most personal work yet .

2 life on the rez is no picnic : this picture shows you why .
0 what you expect is just what you get ... assuming the bar of expectations has n't been raised above sixth-grade height .
3 the campy results make mel brooks ' borscht belt schtick look sophisticated .

1 two badly interlocked stories drowned by all too clever complexity .
2 when the violence actually shocked ?
0 aloof and lacks any real raw emotion , which is fatal for a film that relies on personal relationships .
2 an ambitious , serious film that manages to do virtually everything wrong ; sitting through it is something akin to an act of cinematic penance .

1 replacing john carpenter 's stylish tracking shots is degraded , handheld blair witch video-cam footage .
3 the film delivers what it promises : a look at the `` wild ride '' that ensues when brash young men set out to conquer the online world with laptops , cell phones and sketchy business plans .
3 it thankfully goes easy on the reel\/real world dichotomy that -lrb- jaglom -rrb- pursued with such enervating determination in venice\/venice .
1 a fake street drama that keeps telling you things instead of showing them .
1 like showgirls and glitter , the most entertaining moments here are unintentional .
2 possession is in the end an honorable , interesting failure .

4 a sexy , surprising romance ... idemoto and kim make a gorgeous pair ... their scenes brim with sexual possibility and emotional danger .
2 barely .
4 there are n't too many films that can be as simultaneously funny , offbeat and heartwarming -lrb- without a thick shmear of the goo , at least -rrb- , but `` elling '' manages to do all three quite well , making it one of the year 's most enjoyable releases .

3 strange and beautiful film .
2 a fast-paced , glitzy but extremely silly piece .
1 the histrionic muse still eludes madonna and , playing a charmless witch , she is merely a charmless witch .

3 from blushing to gushing -- imamura squirts the screen in ` warm water under a red bridge '
4 delight your senses and crash this wedding !
4 the best thing i can say about this film is that i ca n't wait to see what the director does next .
3 ... wallace is smart to vary the pitch of his movie , balancing deafening battle scenes with quieter domestic scenes of women back home receiving war department telegrams .

4 a true-blue delight .
0 about as enjoyable , i would imagine , as searching for a quarter in a giant pile of elephant feces ... positively dreadful .

4 whatever heartwarming scene the impressively discreet filmmakers may have expected to record with their mini dv , they show a remarkable ability to document both sides of this emotional car-wreck .

2 s face is chillingly unemotive , yet he communicates a great deal in his performance .
3 handsome and sophisticated approach to the workplace romantic comedy .
1 schaefer 's ... determination to inject farcical raunch ... drowns out the promise of the romantic angle .
3 huppert 's show to steal and she makes a meal of it , channeling kathy baker 's creepy turn as the repressed mother on boston public just as much as 8 women 's augustine .

0 may cause you to bite your tongue to keep from laughing at the ridiculous dialog or the oh-so convenient plot twists .
3 terry is a sort of geriatric dirty harry , which will please eastwood 's loyal fans -- and suits the story , wherein our hero must ride roughshod over incompetent cops to get his man .
1 costner 's warm-milk persona is just as ill-fitting as shadyac 's perfunctory directing chops , and some of the more overtly silly dialogue would sink laurence olivier .

4 promises is one film that 's truly deserving of its oscar nomination .
2 this one is strictly a lightweight escapist film .
4 impossible as it may sound , this film 's heart is even more embracing than monty , if only because it accepts nasty behavior and severe flaws as part of the human condition .

3 fessenden has nurtured his metaphors at the expense of his narrative , but he does display an original talent .

2 it bites hard .

0 by the time you reach the finale , you 're likely wondering why you 've been watching all this strutting and posturing .
0 a predictable , manipulative stinker .
0 ... post-september 11 , `` the sum of all fears '' seems more tacky and reprehensible , manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves .

1 squandering his opportunity to make absurdist observations , burns gets caught up in the rush of slapstick thoroughfare .
2 it plays like a big-budget , after-school special with a generous cast , who at times lift the material from its well-meaning clunkiness .

4 as satisfyingly odd and intriguing a tale as it was a century and a half ago ... has a delightfully dour , deadpan tone and stylistic consistency .
4 elvira fans could hardly ask for more .

3 robert harmon 's less-is-more approach delivers real bump-in - the-night chills -- his greatest triumph is keeping the creepy crawlies hidden in the film 's thick shadows .
0 ... a sour little movie at its core ; an exploration of the emptiness that underlay the relentless gaiety of the 1920 's ... the film 's ending has a `` what was it all for ? ''

4 ferrara 's strongest and most touching movie of recent years .
1 ... a cinematic disaster so inadvertently sidesplitting it 's worth the price of admission for the ridicule factor alone .

3 it 's definitely a step in the right direction .

3 it 's a scorcher .
0 a real snooze .
3 like its title character , this nicholas nickleby finds itself in reduced circumstances -- and , also like its hero , it remains brightly optimistic , coming through in the end .
1 the kids in the audience at the preview screening seemed bored , cheering the pratfalls but little else ; their parents , wise folks that they are , read books .

0 for its 100 minutes running time , you 'll wait in vain for a movie to happen .
3 a chronicle not only of one man 's quest to be president , but of how that man single-handedly turned a plane full of hard-bitten , cynical journalists into what was essentially , by campaign 's end , an extended publicity department .

1 even fans of ismail merchant 's work , i suspect , would have a hard time sitting through this one .
1 the high-concept scenario soon proves preposterous , the acting is robotically italicized , and truth-in-advertising hounds take note : there 's very little hustling on view .
1 what 's worse is that pelosi knows it .
1 a `` home alone '' film that is staged like `` rosemary 's baby , '' but is not as well-conceived as either of those films .
1 although made on a shoestring and unevenly acted , conjures a lynch-like vision of the rotting underbelly of middle america .

1 i found the movie as divided against itself as the dysfunctional family it portrays .
3 too daft by half ... but supremely good natured .

3 the first five minutes will have you talking 'til the end of the year !
1 ... silly humbuggery ...
2 nair and writer laura cahill dare to build a movie around some flawed but rather unexceptional women , emerging with a fine character study that 's short on plot but rich in the tiny revelations of real life .
1 predecessors the mummy and the mummy returns stand as intellectual masterpieces next to the scorpion king .

3 if s&m seems like a strange route to true love , maybe it is , but it 's to this film 's -lrb- and its makers ' -rrb- credit that we believe that that 's exactly what these two people need to find each other -- and themselves .
1 little is done to support the premise other than fling gags at it to see which ones shtick .

3 seeks to transcend its genre with a curiously stylized , quasi-shakespearean portrait of pure misogynist evil .
1 not a stereotype is omitted nor a cliché left unsaid .
3 a smart , steamy mix of road movie , coming-of-age story and political satire .
1 it 's coherent , well shot , and tartly acted , but it wears you down like a dinner guest showing off his doctorate .
2 wraps itself in the guise of a dark and quirky comedy , but it is n't as quirky as it thinks it is and its comedy is generally mean-spirited .
3 k-19 will not go down in the annals of cinema as one of the great submarine stories , but it is an engaging and exciting narrative of man confronting the demons of his own fear and paranoia .
3 a four star performance from kevin kline who unfortunately works with a two star script .
3 god bless crudup and his aversion to taking the easy hollywood road and cashing in on his movie-star gorgeousness .
4 it 's a feel-good movie about which you can actually feel good .
2 the movie is our story as much as it is schmidt 's , no matter if it 's viewed as a self-reflection or cautionary tale .
3 if anything , see it for karen black , who camps up a storm as a fringe feminist conspiracy theorist named dirty dick .
3 watching the chemistry between freeman and judd , however , almost makes this movie worth seeing .
2 mark wahlberg ... may look classy in a '60s - homage pokepie hat , but as a character he 's dry , dry , dry .
2 a film that will probably please people already fascinated by behan but leave everyone else yawning with admiration .
3 moonlight mile gives itself the freedom to feel contradictory things .
3 it 's a movie that accomplishes so much that one viewing ca n't possibly be enough .
3 the film aims to be funny , uplifting and moving , sometimes all at once .
2 like being trapped inside a huge video game , where exciting , inane images keep popping past your head and the same illogical things keep happening over and over again .
1 the film never gets over its own investment in conventional arrangements , in terms of love , age , gender , race , and class .
3 nicely combines the enigmatic features of ` memento ' with the hallucinatory drug culture of ` requiem for a dream . '
2 last dance , whatever its flaws , fulfills one facet of its mission in making me want to find out whether , in this case , that 's true .
1 sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish , and the film only really comes alive when poor hermocrates and leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours .
1 -lrb- a -rrb- stale retread of the '53 original .
4 more concerned with overall feelings , broader ideas , and open-ended questions than concrete story and definitive answers , soderbergh 's solaris is a gorgeous and deceptively minimalist cinematic tone poem .
3 alarms for duvall 's throbbing sincerity and his elderly propensity for patting people while he talks .
1 there 's no point in extracting the bare bones of byatt 's plot for purposes of bland hollywood romance .
3 the performances are amiable and committed , and the comedy more often than not hits the bullseye .
1 zigzag might have been richer and more observant if it were less densely plotted .
0 to better understand why this did n't connect with me would require another viewing , and i wo n't be sitting through this one again ... that in itself is commentary enough .
1 is a question for philosophers , not filmmakers ; all the filmmakers need to do is engage an audience .
1 at some point , all this visual trickery stops being clever and devolves into flashy , vaguely silly overkill .
0 a ragbag of cliches .
1 overburdened with complicated plotting and banal dialogue
3 the picture runs a mere 84 minutes , but it 's no glance .
3 steers refreshingly clear of the usual cliches .
3 niccol the filmmaker merges his collaborators ' symbolic images with his words , insinuating , for example , that in hollywood , only god speaks to the press
4 it 's a beautiful film , full of elaborate and twisted characters - and it 's also pretty funny .
1 the milieu is wholly unconvincing ... and the histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch .
0 the picture emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment .
3 whatever complaints i might have , i 'd take -lrb- its -rrb- earnest errors and hard-won rewards over the bombastic self-glorification of other feel-good fiascos like antwone fisher or the emperor 's club any time .
1 rice never clearly defines his characters or gives us a reason to care about them .
2 though not for everyone , the guys is a somber trip worth taking .
3 another entertaining romp from robert rodriguez .
1 but here 's a movie about it anyway .
3 if -lrb- jaglom 's -rrb- latest effort is not the director at his most sparkling , some of its repartee is still worth hearing .
1 i did n't smile .
4 the script by david koepp is perfectly serviceable and because he gives the story some soul ... he elevates the experience to a more mythic level .
1 kapur fails to give his audience a single character worth rooting for -lrb- or worth rooting against , for that matter -rrb- .
3 it 's a visual delight and a decent popcorn adventure , as long as you do n't try to look too deep into the story
2 see it now , before the inevitable hollywood remake flattens out all its odd , intriguing wrinkles .
1 befuddled in its characterizations as it begins to seem as long as the two year affair which is its subject
0 nothing more than an amiable but unfocused bagatelle that plays like a loosely-connected string of acting-workshop exercises .
0 it 's horribly depressing and not very well done .
2 veterans of the dating wars will smirk uneasily at the film 's nightmare versions of everyday sex-in-the-city misadventures .
3 now as a former gong show addict , i 'll admit it , my only complaint is that we did n't get more re-creations of all those famous moments from the show .
2 ryosuke has created a wry , winning , if languidly paced , meditation on the meaning and value of family .
3 enough may pander to our basest desires for payback , but unlike many revenge fantasies , it ultimately delivers .
2 i prefer soderbergh 's concentration on his two lovers over tarkovsky 's mostly male , mostly patriarchal debating societies .
1 this is cruel , misanthropic stuff with only weak claims to surrealism and black comedy .
1 a pale xerox of other , better crime movies .
3 strange it is , but delightfully so .
1 the story has little wit and no surprises .
0 crummy .
0 just another disjointed , fairly predictable psychological thriller .
4 this is a very funny , heartwarming film .
2 ` rare birds ' tries to force its quirkiness upon the audience .
3 good-naturedly cornball sequel .
2 the tone errs on the shrill side , tempered by a soft southern gentility that speaks of beauty , grace and a closet full of skeletons .
0 the french director has turned out nearly 21\/2 hours of unfocused , excruciatingly tedious cinema that , half an hour in , starts making water torture seem appealing .
1 it 's only in fairy tales that princesses that are married for political reason live happily ever after .
2 feardotcom 's thrills are all cheap , but they mostly work .
2 a static and sugary little half-hour , after-school special about interfaith understanding , stretched out to 90 minutes .
4 a small movie with a big impact .
1 the sort of picture in which , whenever one of the characters has some serious soul searching to do , they go to a picture-perfect beach during sunset .
3 crammed with incident , and bristles with passion and energy .
4 an intelligent and deeply felt work about impossible , irrevocable choices and the price of making them .
3 -lrb- gosling 's -rrb- combination of explosive physical energy and convincing intelligence helps create a complex , unpredictable character .
3 and it sees those relationships , including that between the son and his wife , and the wife and the father , and between the two brothers , with incredible subtlety and acumen .
2 though it inspires some -lrb- out-of-field -rrb- creative thought , the film is -- to its own detriment -- much more a cinematic collage than a polemical tract .
1 in the new guy , even the bull gets recycled .
1 reggio and glass so rhapsodize cynicism , with repetition and languorous slo-mo sequences , that glass 's dirgelike score becomes a fang-baring lullaby .
3 marshall puts a suspenseful spin on standard horror flick formula .
1 there might be some sort of credible gender-provoking philosophy submerged here , but who the hell cares ?
1 a movie that 's held captive by mediocrity .
2 screenwriter chris ver weil 's directing debut is good-natured and never dull , but its virtues are small and easily overshadowed by its predictability .
4 an admirable , sometimes exceptional film
3 this is a film that manages to find greatness in the hue of its drastic iconography .
3 a whole lot of fun and funny in the middle , though somewhat less hard-hitting at the start and finish .
3 ... spiced with humor -lrb- ' i speak fluent flatula , ' advises denlopp after a rather , er , bubbly exchange with an alien deckhand -rrb- and witty updatings -lrb- silver 's parrot has been replaced with morph , a cute alien creature who mimics everyone and everything around -rrb-
1 has a customarily jovial air but a deficit of flim-flam inventiveness .
3 not all of the stories work and the ones that do are thin and scattered , but the film works well enough to make it worth watching .
4 a strangely stirring experience that finds warmth in the coldest environment and makes each crumb of emotional comfort feel like a 10-course banquet .
4 matthew lillard is born to play shaggy !
1 a dark-as-pitch comedy that frequently veers into corny sentimentality , probably would not improve much after a therapeutic zap of shock treatment .
3 there 's lots of cool stuff packed into espn 's ultimate x.
3 the mothman prophecies is best when illustrating the demons bedevilling the modern masculine journey .
3 at its best , it 's black hawk down with more heart .
2 `` home movie '' is the film equivalent of a lovingly rendered coffee table book .
4 invigorating , surreal , and resonant with a rainbow of emotion .
1 a tired , unimaginative and derivative variation of that already-shallow genre .
1 patchy combination of soap opera , low-tech magic realism and , at times , ploddingly sociological commentary .
2 a frustrating yet deeply watchable melodrama that makes you think it 's a tougher picture than it is .
3 a solid cast , assured direction and complete lack of modern day irony .
3 rodriguez has the chops of a smart-aleck film school brat and the imagination of a big kid ...
2 arnie blows things up .
2 if you 're really renting this you 're not interested in discretion in your entertainment choices , you 're interested in anne geddes , john grisham , and thomas kincaid .
1 a movie you observe , rather than one you enter into .
1 should have been worth cheering as a breakthrough but is devoid of wit and humor .
3 -lrb- barry -rrb- gives assassin a disquieting authority .
1 its plot and animation offer daytime tv serviceability , but little more .
4 a moving and important film .
4 these people are really going to love the piano teacher .
1 a disappointment for a movie that should have been the ultimate imax trip .
1 a portrait of alienation so perfect , it will certainly succeed in alienating most viewers .
3 yes , but also intriguing and honorable , a worthwhile addition to a distinguished film legacy .
3 `` cremaster 3 '' should come with the warning `` for serious film buffs only ! ''
2 this big screen caper has a good bark , far from being a bow-wow .
3 what 's most refreshing about real women have curves is its unforced comedy-drama and its relaxed , natural-seeming actors .
3 surprisingly insightful
3 to those who have not read the book , the film is a much better mother-daughter tale than last summer 's ` divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood , ' but that 's not saying much .
0 the director , with his fake backdrops and stately pacing , never settles on a consistent tone .
1 earnest yet curiously tepid and choppy recycling in which predictability is the only winner .
4 brash , intelligent and erotically perplexing , haneke 's portrait of an upper class austrian society and the suppression of its tucked away demons is uniquely felt with a sardonic jolt .
2 a glorious mess .
2 unfortunately , contrived plotting , stereotyped characters and woo 's over-the-top instincts as a director undermine the moral dilemma at the movie 's heart .
4 arguably the best script that besson has written in years .
1 it is most of the things costner movies are known for ; it 's sanctimonious , self-righteous and so eager to earn our love that you want to slap it .
1 pretend it 's a werewolf itself by avoiding eye contact and walking slowly away .
0 you can fire a torpedo through some of clancy 's holes , and the scripters do n't deserve any oscars .
0 truly terrible .
0 it 's hard to imagine acting that could be any flatter .
2 you just know something terrible is going to happen .
1 each scene drags , underscoring the obvious , and sentiment is slathered on top .
1 fluffy neo-noir hiding behind cutesy film references .
4 a special kind of movie , this melancholic film noir reminded me a lot of memento ...
2 do n't expect any subtlety from this latest entry in the increasingly threadbare gross-out comedy cycle .
4 one of the most genuinely sweet films to come along in quite some time .
1 a film really has to be exceptional to justify a three hour running time , and this is n't .
2 too ordinary to restore -lrb- harmon -rrb- to prominence , despite some creepy scenes that evoke childish night terrors , and a praiseworthy attempt to generate suspense rather than gross out the audience .
4 highly watchable stuff .
4 exceptionally well acted by diane lane and richard gere .
2 there 's no real reason to see it , and no real reason not to .
1 content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger - all for easy sanctimony , formulaic thrills and a ham-fisted sermon on the need for national health insurance .
3 a charming but slight comedy .
2 you know that ten bucks you 'd spend on a ticket ?
2 everything else about high crimes is , like the military system of justice it portrays , tiresomely regimented .
3 an unusually dry-eyed , even analytical approach to material that is generally played for maximum moisture .
1 a beyond-lame satire , teddy bears ' picnic ranks among the most pitiful directing debuts by an esteemed writer-actor .
0 it looks like an action movie , but it 's so poorly made , on all levels , that it does n't even qualify as a spoof of such .
2 takes one character we do n't like and another we do n't believe , and puts them into a battle of wills that is impossible to care about and is n't very funny .
4 but mostly it 's a work that , with humor , warmth , and intelligence , captures a life interestingly lived .
3 as an introduction to the man 's theories and influence , derrida is all but useless ; as a portrait of the artist as an endlessly inquisitive old man , however , it 's invaluable .
4 young hanks and fisk , who vaguely resemble their celebrity parents , bring fresh good looks and an ease in front of the camera to the work .
4 excellent performances from jacqueline bisset and martha plimpton grace this deeply touching melodrama .
3 the cast is spot on and the mood is laid back .
1 its generic villains lack any intrigue -lrb- other than their funny accents -rrb- and the action scenes are poorly delivered .
3 while bollywood\/hollywood will undoubtedly provide its keenest pleasures to those familiar with bombay musicals , it also has plenty for those -lrb- like me -rrb- who are n't .
0 has no reason to exist , other than to employ hollywood kids and people who owe favors to their famous parents .
0 in a big corner office in hell , satan is throwing up his hands in surrender , is firing his r&d people , and has decided he will just screen the master of disguise 24\/7 .
3 captures all the longing , anguish and ache , the confusing sexual messages and the wish to be a part of that elusive adult world .
3 in a movie full of surprises , the biggest is that secret ballot is a comedy , both gentle and biting .
2 ... passable enough for a shoot-out in the o.k. court house of life type of flick .
0 deep down , i realized the harsh reality of my situation : i would leave the theater with a lower i.q. than when i had entered .
4 a chance to see three splendid actors turn a larky chase movie into an emotionally satisfying exploration of the very human need to be somebody , and to belong to somebody .
4 well cast and well directed - a powerful drama with enough sardonic wit to keep it from being maudlin .
3 an ambitiously naturalistic , albeit half-baked , drama about an abused , inner-city autistic teen .
1 it is just too bad the film 's story does not live up to its style .
2 just how these families interact may surprise you .
3 a wild ride juiced with enough energy and excitement for at least three films .
1 a muted freak-out
4 lead actress gaï , she of the impossibly long limbs and sweetly conspiratorial smile , is a towering siren .
1 absolutely not .
3 by turns gripping , amusing , tender and heart-wrenching , laissez-passer has all the earmarks of french cinema at its best .
3 the cat 's meow marks a return to form for director peter bogdanovich ...
2 ... jones , despite a definitely distinctive screen presence , just is n't able to muster for a movie that , its title notwithstanding , should have been a lot nastier if it wanted to fully capitalize on its lead 's specific gifts .
2 generic slasher-movie nonsense , but it 's not without style .
2 fans of so-bad-they 're - good cinema may find some fun in this jumbled mess .
4 vibrantly colored and beautifully designed , metropolis is a feast for the eyes .
2 brown 's saga , like many before his , makes for snappy prose but a stumblebum of a movie .
3 ` stock up on silver bullets for director neil marshall 's intense freight train of a film . '
3 at its best , which occurs often , michael moore 's bowling for columbine rekindles the muckraking , soul-searching spirit of the ` are we a sick society ? '
1 in the real world , an actor this uncharismatically beautiful would have a résumé loaded with credits like `` girl in bar # 3 . ''
2 hope keeps arising that the movie will live up to the apparent skills of its makers and the talents of its actors , but it does n't .
1 barney throws away the goodwill the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull .
3 an indispensable peek at the art and the agony of making people laugh .
4 at 78 minutes it just zings along with vibrance and warmth .
3 the film , while not exactly assured in its execution , is notable for its sheer audacity and openness .
2 dull and mechanical , kinda like a very goofy museum exhibit
1 it 's sweet and fluffy at the time , but it may leave you feeling a little sticky and unsatisfied .
3 sayles has an eye for the ways people of different ethnicities talk to and about others outside the group .
2 brady achieves the remarkable feat of squandering a topnotch foursome of actors ... by shoving them into every clichéd white-trash situation imaginable .
3 the irony is that this film 's cast is uniformly superb ; their performances could have -- should have -- been allowed to stand on their own .
2 this slow-moving swedish film offers not even a hint of joy , preferring to focus on the humiliation of martin as he defecates in bed and urinates on the plants at his own birthday party .
3 i admire the closing scenes of the film , which seem to ask whether our civilization offers a cure for vincent 's complaint .
0 a dreary movie .
3 a thriller whose style , structure and rhythms are so integrated with the story , you can not separate them .
0 cruel and inhuman cinematic punishment ... simultaneously degrades its characters , its stars and its audience .
1 you may think you have figured out the con and the players in this debut film by argentine director fabian bielinsky , but while you were thinking someone made off with your wallet .
0 the premise itself is just sooooo tired .
3 like any good romance , son of the bride , proves it 's never too late to learn .
0 the emotional overload of female angst irreparably drags the film down .
3 there 's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there 's nothing else happening .
4 an engrossing and grim portrait of hookers : what they think of themselves and their clients .
2 like mike is a harmlessly naïve slice of b-ball fantasy , fit for filling in during the real nba 's off-season .
3 a lovely and beautifully photographed romance .
2 in the end , all you can do is admire the ensemble players and wonder what the point of it is .
1 ... while each moment of this broken character study is rich in emotional texture , the journey does n't really go anywhere .
3 the film 's messages of tolerance and diversity are n't particularly original , but one ca n't help but be drawn in by the sympathetic characters .
0 aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom.com or the improperly hammy performance from poor stephen rea , the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand .
4 i had more fun watching spy than i had with most of the big summer movies .
4 a simple tale of an unlikely friendship , but thanks to the gorgeous locales and exceptional lead performances , it has considerable charm .
4 no such thing is sort of a minimalist beauty and the beast , but in this case the beast should definitely get top billing .
3 it 's not particularly well made , but since i found myself howling more than cringing , i 'd say the film works .
3 aniston has at last decisively broken with her friends image in an independent film of satiric fire and emotional turmoil .
0 ... blade ii is still top-heavy with blazing guns , cheatfully filmed martial arts , disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and jagged camera moves that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves .
1 every joke is repeated at least four times .
3 a smart and funny , albeit sometimes superficial , cautionary tale of a technology in search of an artist .
3 if you like an extreme action-packed film with a hint of humor , then triple x marks the spot .
2 otherwise , maybe .
4 stanley kwan has directed not only one of the best gay love stories ever made , but one of the best love stories of any stripe .
4 just about the best straight-up , old-school horror film of the last 15 years .
2 please see previous answer .
3 in the director 's cut , the film is not only a love song to the movies but it also is more fully an example of the kind of lush , all-enveloping movie experience it rhapsodizes .
2 `` not really as bad as you might think ! ''
4 samuel l. jackson is one of the best actors there is .
3 it does give a taste of the burning man ethos , an appealing blend of counter-cultural idealism and hedonistic creativity .
3 a plethora of engaging diatribes on the meaning of ` home , ' delivered in grand passion by the members of the various households .
2 the result is good gossip , entertainingly delivered , yet with a distinctly musty odour , its expiry date long gone .
2 has some visual wit ... but little imagination elsewhere .
1 an imponderably stilted and self-consciously arty movie .
3 this real-life hollywood fairy-tale is more engaging than the usual fantasies hollywood produces .
3 waiting for godard can be fruitful : ` in praise of love ' is the director 's epitaph for himself .
4 it 's all about anakin ... and the lustrous polished visuals rich in color and creativity and , of course , special effect .
1 solondz is so intent on hammering home his message that he forgets to make it entertaining .
2 so here it is : it 's about a family of sour immortals .
0 ... pitiful , slapdash disaster .
0 the crap continues .
3 while the story 's undeniably hard to follow , iwai 's gorgeous visuals seduce .
0 it 's a terrible movie in every regard , and utterly painful to watch .
1 this is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking : joyless , idiotic , annoying , heavy-handed , visually atrocious , and often downright creepy .
3 a rock-solid gangster movie with a fair amount of suspense , intriguing characters and bizarre bank robberies , plus a heavy dose of father-and-son dynamics .
4 a terrific b movie -- in fact , the best in recent memory .
0 unfortunately , the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making .
3 i liked about schmidt a lot , but i have a feeling that i would have liked it much more if harry & tonto never existed .
1 what starts off as a potentially incredibly twisting mystery becomes simply a monster chase film .
3 you may leave the theater with more questions than answers , but darned if your toes wo n't still be tapping .
0 nobody seems to have cared much about any aspect of it , from its cheesy screenplay to the grayish quality of its lighting to its last-minute , haphazard theatrical release .
1 as in aimless , arduous , and arbitrary .
3 aside from rohmer 's bold choices regarding point of view , the lady and the duke represents the filmmaker 's lifelong concern with formalist experimentation in cinematic art .
4 a fascinating glimpse into an insular world that gives the lie to many clichés and showcases a group of dedicated artists .
1 this is a poster movie , a mediocre tribute to films like them !
1 there is no solace here , no entertainment value , merely a fierce lesson in where filmmaking can take us .
3 the graphic carnage and re-creation of war-torn croatia is uncomfortably timely , relevant , and sickeningly real .
3 the ingenious construction -lrb- adapted by david hare from michael cunningham 's novel -rrb- constantly flows forwards and back , weaving themes among three strands which allow us to view events as if through a prism
2 or both .
0 the most horrific movie experience i 've had since `` ca n't stop the music . ''
3 but it also has many of the things that made the first one charming .
2 whether you like it or not is basically a matter of taste .
4 weaver and lapaglia are both excellent , in the kind of low-key way that allows us to forget that they are actually movie folk .
3 it 's never laugh-out-loud funny , but it is frequently amusing .
3 a movie in which laughter and self-exploitation merge into jolly soft-porn 'em powerment . '
4 quite simply , a joy to watch and -- especially -- to listen to .
4 not to mention absolutely refreshed .
4 you can take the grandkids or the grandparents and never worry about anyone being bored ... audience is a sea of constant smiles and frequent laughter .
2 both the crime story and the love story are unusual .
3 arteta paints a picture of lives lived in a state of quiet desperation .
4 there 's no reason to miss interview with the assassin
2 sayles is making a statement about the inability of dreams and aspirations to carry forward into the next generation .
4 i like this movie a lot .
1 comes off more like a misdemeanor , a flat , unconvincing drama that never catches fire .
2 this sci-fi techno-sex thriller starts out bizarre and just keeps getting weirder .
3 close enough in spirit to its freewheeling trash-cinema roots to be a breath of fresh air .
2 a dreary indulgence .
2 teens only .
1 while the transgressive trappings -lrb- especially the frank sex scenes -rrb- ensure that the film is never dull , rodrigues 's beast-within metaphor is ultimately rather silly and overwrought , making the ambiguous ending seem goofy rather than provocative .
1 blue crush has all the trappings of an energetic , extreme-sports adventure , but ends up more of a creaky `` pretty woman '' retread , with the emphasis on self-empowering schmaltz and big-wave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought .
2 the movie does has some entertainment value - how much depends on how well you like chris rock .
4 a man leaving the screening said the film was better than saving private ryan .
2 the niftiest trick perpetrated by the importance of being earnest is the alchemical transmogrification of wilde into austen -- and a hollywood-ized austen at that .
3 -lrb- a -rrb- strong piece of work .
4 daring and beautifully made .
2 there has to be a few advantages to never growing old .
3 a well-crafted film that is all the more remarkable because it achieves its emotional power and moments of revelation with restraint and a delicate ambiguity .
2 with three excellent principal singers , a youthful and good-looking diva and tenor and richly handsome locations , it 's enough to make you wish jacquot had left well enough alone and just filmed the opera without all these distortions of perspective .
1 ... hits every cliche we 've come to expect , including the assumption that `` crazy '' people are innocent , childlike and inherently funny .
3 slight but enjoyable documentary .
0 adam sandler 's eight crazy nights grows on you -- like a rash .
4 when compared to the usual , more somber festival entries , davis ' highly personal brand of romantic comedy is a tart , smart breath of fresh air that stands out from the pack even if the picture itself is somewhat problematic .
1 nicks and steinberg match their own creations for pure venality -- that 's giving it the old college try .
1 not even solondz 's thirst for controversy , sketchy characters and immature provocations can fully succeed at cheapening it .
1 and in a sense , that 's a liability .
1 the romance between the leads is n't as compelling or as believable as it should be .
4 hugh grant , who has a good line in charm , has never been more charming than in about a boy .
3 poignant and funny .
4 this is pure , exciting moviemaking .
0 never having seen the first two films in the series , i ca n't compare friday after next to them , but nothing would change the fact that what we have here is a load of clams left in the broiling sun for a good three days .
2 the film is a blunt indictment , part of a perhaps surreal campaign to bring kissinger to trial for crimes against humanity .
1 a straight-ahead thriller that never rises above superficiality .
4 the film 's constant mood of melancholy and its unhurried narrative are masterfully controlled .
4 there are scenes of cinematic perfection that steal your heart away .
3 a low-key labor of love that strikes a very resonant chord .
4 one of those movies that catches you up in something bigger than yourself , namely , an archetypal desire to enjoy good trash every now and then .
3 an old-fashioned scary movie , one that relies on lingering terror punctuated by sudden shocks and not constant bloodshed punctuated by flying guts .
3 there 's an energy to y tu mamá también .
1 the problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of auschwitz ii-birkenau .
0 the whole mess boils down to a transparently hypocritical work that feels as though it 's trying to set the women 's liberation movement back 20 years . '
0 not even steven spielberg has dreamed up such blatant and sickening product placement in a movie .
4 miyazaki is one of world cinema 's most wondrously gifted artists and storytellers .
0 the paradiso 's rusted-out ruin and ultimate collapse during the film 's final -lrb- restored -rrb- third ... emotionally belittle a cinema classic .
3 if you 're down for a silly hack-and-slash flick , you can do no wrong with jason x.
3 all in all , an interesting look at the life of the campaign-trail press , especially ones that do n't really care for the candidate they 're forced to follow .
1 in the not-too-distant future , movies like ghost ship will be used as analgesic balm for overstimulated minds .
2 some movies can get by without being funny simply by structuring the scenes as if they were jokes : a setup , delivery and payoff .
4 ryan gosling is , in a word , brilliant as the conflicted daniel .
1 i do n't think so .
1 at best this is a film for the under-7 crowd .
4 a fresh , entertaining comedy that looks at relationships minus traditional gender roles .
4 poetry in motion captured on film .
2 the fourth in a series that i 'll bet most parents had thought -- hoped !
1 parts of the film feel a bit too much like an infomercial for ram dass 's latest book aimed at the boomer demographic .
1 the script is a dim-witted pairing of teen-speak and animal gibberish .
2 but here 's a glimpse at his life .
1 almost peerlessly unsettling .
1 despite auteuil 's performance , it 's a rather listless amble down the middle of the road , where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug .

3 the performances are strong , though the subject matter demands acting that borders on hammy at times .
1 never does `` lilo & stitch '' reach the emotion or timelessness of disney 's great past , or even that of more recent successes such as `` mulan '' or `` tarzan . ''
4 a wild ride with eight boarders from venice beach that was a deserved co-winner of the audience award for documentaries at the sundance film festival .

4 ozpetek 's effort has the scope and shape of an especially well-executed television movie .
3 too clever by about nine-tenths .
2 you should pay nine bucks for this : because you can hear about suffering afghan refugees on the news and still be unaffected .
2 the whole mildly pleasant outing -- the r rating is for brief nudity and a grisly corpse -- remains aloft not on its own self-referential hot air , but on the inspired performance of tim allen .
3 horns and halos benefits from serendipity but also reminds us of our own responsibility to question what is told as the truth .

2 this is the first film i 've ever seen that had no obvious directing involved .
3 captures that perverse element of the kafkaesque where identity , overnight , is robbed and replaced with a persecuted `` other . ''
3 never once predictable .
1 the film does n't really care about the thousands of americans who die hideously , it cares about how ryan meets his future wife and makes his start at the cia .
4 offers a guilt-free trip into feel-good territory .
1 the filmmakers are playing to the big boys in new york and l.a. to that end , they mock the kind of folks they do n't understand , ones they figure the power-lunchers do n't care to understand , either .
1 i wish it would have just gone more over-the-top instead of trying to have it both ways .
1 the whole affair , true story or not , feels incredibly hokey ... -lrb- it -rrb- comes off like a hallmark commercial .
2 -lrb- allen 's -rrb- been making piffle for a long while , and hollywood ending may be his way of saying that piffle is all that the airhead movie business deserves from him right now .
2 cacoyannis is perhaps too effective in creating an atmosphere of dust-caked stagnation and labored gentility .
3 the structure is simple , but in its own way , rabbit-proof fence is a quest story as grand as the lord of the rings .

3 what emerges is an unsettling picture of childhood innocence combined with indoctrinated prejudice .
4 the 3-d vistas from orbit , with the space station suspended like a huge set of wind chimes over the great blue globe , are stanzas of breathtaking , awe-inspiring visual poetry .
1 cacoyannis ' vision is far less mature , interpreting the play as a call for pity and sympathy for anachronistic phantasms haunting the imagined glory of their own pasts .
3 jackie chan movies are a guilty pleasure - he 's easy to like and always leaves us laughing .

3 this charming but slight tale has warmth , wit and interesting characters compassionately portrayed .
0 the movie slides downhill as soon as macho action conventions assert themselves .
2 streamlined to a tight , brisk 85-minute screwball thriller , `` big trouble '' is funny , harmless and as substantial as a tub of popcorn with extra butter .

1 no thanks .
4 despite the predictable parent vs. child coming-of-age theme , first-class , natural acting and a look at `` the real americans '' make this a charmer .
4 delia , greta , and paula rank as three of the most multilayered and sympathetic female characters of the year .
2 best described as i know what you did last winter .
1 action - mechanical .
0 another wholly unnecessary addition to the growing , moldering pile of , well , extreme stunt pictures .
1 this would have been better than the fiction it has concocted , and there still could have been room for the war scenes .
1 it 's a bad sign in a thriller when you instantly know whodunit .
1 while the production details are lavish , film has little insight into the historical period and its artists , particularly in how sand developed a notorious reputation .
3 although olivier assayas ' elegantly appointed period drama seems , at times , padded with incident in the way of a too-conscientious adaptation ... its three-hour running time plays closer to two .
2 the tonal shifts are jolting , and though wen 's messages are profound and thoughtfully delivered , more thorough transitions would have made the film more cohesive .
2 dense and enigmatic ... elusive ... stagy and stilted
3 the moral shrapnel and mental shellshock will linger long after this film has ended .
1 a sleek advert for youthful anomie that never quite equals the sum of its pretensions .
4 overall , it 's a very entertaining , thought-provoking film with a simple message : god is love .
1 some movies were made for the big screen , some for the small screen , and some , like ballistic : ecks vs. sever , were made for the palm screen .
2 `` on guard ! ''
2 a minor work yet there 's no denying the potency of miller 's strange , fleeting brew of hopeful perseverance and hopeless closure .
4 a confident , richly acted , emotionally devastating piece of work and 2002 's first great film
4 labute 's careful handling makes the material seem genuine rather than pandering .
0 the whole film has this sneaky feel to it -- as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as very important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood product .
1 an inelegant combination of two unrelated shorts that falls far short of the director 's previous work in terms of both thematic content and narrative strength .
3 ... a funny yet dark and seedy clash of cultures and generations .
2 routine and rather silly .
2 denver should not get the first and last look at one of the most triumphant performances of vanessa redgrave 's career .
3 as tricky and satisfying as any of david mamet 's airless cinematic shell games .
2 the best thing that can be said of the picture is that it does have a few cute moments .
3 the story is smart and entirely charming in intent and execution .
2 a different kind of love story - one that is dark , disturbing , painful to watch , yet compelling .
1 the action clichés just pile up .
0 not only does the thoroughly formulaic film represent totally exemplify middle-of-the-road mainstream , it also represents glossy hollywood at its laziest .
4 a delicious and delicately funny look at the residents of a copenhagen neighborhood coping with the befuddling complications life tosses at them .
4 if ever a concept came handed down from the movie gods on a silver platter , this is it .
3 you may be captivated , as i was , by its moods , and by its subtly transformed star , and still wonder why paul thomas anderson ever had the inclination to make the most sincere and artful movie in which adam sandler will probably ever appear .
3 `` brown sugar '' admirably aspires to be more than another `` best man '' clone by weaving a theme throughout this funny film .
3 highlighted by a gritty style and an excellent cast , it 's better than one might expect when you look at the list of movies starring ice-t in a major role .
2 far away .
2 the kind of trifle that date nights were invented for . .
2 all the actors are good in pauline & paulette but van der groen , described as ` belgium 's national treasure , ' is especially terrific as pauline .
3 gently humorous and touching .
1 puportedly `` based on true events , '' a convolution of language that suggests it 's impossible to claim that it is `` based on a true story '' with a straight face .
0 vulgar is too optimistic a title .
0 `` the adventures of pluto nash '' is a big time stinker .
4 visually captivating .
3 as each of them searches for their place in the world , miller digs into their very minds to find an unblinking , flawed humanity .
2 she 's a cipher , played by an actress who smiles and frowns but does n't reveal an inner life .
1 writer-director stephen gaghan has made the near-fatal mistake of being what the english call ` too clever by half . '
0 for the future , one hopes mr. plympton will find room for one more member of his little band , a professional screenwriter .
3 the story plays out slowly , but the characters are intriguing and realistic .
3 very predictable but still entertaining
1 if you 're not a fan , it might be like trying to eat brussels sprouts .
3 has far more energy , wit and warmth than should be expected from any movie with a `` 2 '' at the end of its title .
4 mr. deeds is sure to give you a lot of laughs in this simple , sweet and romantic comedy .
1 it all seemed wasted like deniro 's once promising career and the once grand long beach boardwalk .
4 its gentle , touching story creeps into your heart .
4 armed with a game supporting cast , from the pitch-perfect forster to the always hilarious meara and levy , like mike shoots and scores , doing its namesake proud .
2 gloriously straight from the vagina .
3 ... works on some levels and is certainly worth seeing at least once .
1 a potentially good comic premise and excellent cast are terribly wasted .
4 a small gem from belgium .
2 courtney chases stuart with a cell phone .
4 the characters are complex and quirky , but entirely believable as the remarkable ensemble cast brings them to life .
3 worth a look as a curiosity .
2 it is a testament of quiet endurance , of common concern , of reconciled survival .
1 if you 've got a house full of tots -- do n't worry , this will be on video long before they grow up and you can wait till then .
1 eddie murphy and owen wilson have a cute partnership in i spy , but the movie around them is so often nearly nothing that their charm does n't do a load of good .
3 short and sweet , but also more than anything else slight ... tadpole pulls back from the consequences of its own actions and revelations .
3 poignant and delicately complex .
3 and we do n't avert our eyes for a moment .
4 simply and eloquently articulates the tangled feelings of particular new yorkers deeply touched by an unprecedented tragedy .
2 plays like a checklist of everything rob reiner and his cast were sending up .
4 ... could easily be called the best korean film of 2002 .
0 the title , alone , should scare any sane person away .
1 for all the time we spend with these people , we never really get inside of them .
3 it does n't matter that the film is less than 90 minutes .
0 the plot is paper-thin and the characters are n't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours .
2 this english-language version ... does full honor to miyazaki 's teeming and often unsettling landscape , and to the conflicted complexity of his characters .
2 whether quitting will prove absorbing to american audiences is debatable .
4 the film is a hoot , and is just as good , if not better than much of what 's on saturday morning tv especially the pseudo-educational stuff we all ca n't stand .
3 the ending feels at odds with the rest of the film .
3 in the end there is one word that best describes this film : honest .
0 the movie barely makes sense , with its unbelievable naïveté and arbitrary flashbacks .
3 it 's a quirky , off-beat project .
4 if you can get past the taboo subject matter , it will be well worth your time .
3 coy but exhilarating , with really solid performances by ving rhames and wesley snipes .
3 starts slowly , but adrien brody -- in the title role -- helps make the film 's conclusion powerful and satisfying .
1 feeble comedy .
1 no amount of blood and disintegrating vampire cadavers can obscure this movie 's lack of ideas .
2 simply does n't have sufficient heft to justify its two-hour running time .
1 ... the good and different idea -lrb- of middle-aged romance -rrb- is not handled well and , except for the fine star performances , there is little else to recommend `` never again . ''
2 parker should be commended for taking a fresh approach to familiar material , but his determination to remain true to the original text leads him to adopt a somewhat mannered tone ... that ultimately dulls the human tragedy at the story 's core .
1 would that greengrass had gone a tad less for grit and a lot more for intelligibility .
1 sadly , as blood work proves , that was a long , long time ago .
4 the performers are so spot on , it is hard to conceive anyone else in their roles .
1 the first mistake , i suspect , is casting shatner as a legendary professor and kunis as a brilliant college student -- where 's pauly shore as the rocket scientist ?
3 wise and deadpan humorous .
1 twenty-three movies into a mostly magnificent directorial career , clint eastwood 's efficiently minimalist style finally has failed him .
0 boring and meandering .
1 while certainly more naturalistic than its australian counterpart , amari 's film falls short in building the drama of lilia 's journey .
1 make chan 's action sequences boring .
1 simply put , there should have been a more compelling excuse to pair susan sarandon and goldie hawn .
1 proves a lovely trifle that , unfortunately , is a little too in love with its own cuteness .
1 but its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless .
4 an energizing , intoxicating documentary charting the rise of hip-hop culture in general and the art of scratching -lrb- or turntablism -rrb- in particular .
3 screenwriter dan schneider and director shawn levy substitute volume and primary colors for humor and bite .
2 but if you 've paid a matinee price and bought a big tub of popcorn , there 's guilty fun to be had here .
4 -lrb- ramsay -rrb- visually transforms the dreary expanse of dead-end distaste the characters inhabit into a poem of art , music and metaphor .
4 works as pretty contagious fun .
3 in the pianist , polanski is saying what he has long wanted to say , confronting the roots of his own preoccupations and obsessions , and he allows nothing to get in the way .
2 a dark , dull thriller with a parting shot that misfires .
1 ... liotta is put in an impossible spot because his character 's deceptions ultimately undo him and the believability of the entire scenario .
1 if there was ever a movie where the upbeat ending feels like a copout , this is the one .
1 ... the cast portrays their cartoon counterparts well ... but quite frankly , scoob and shag do n't eat enough during the film . '
0 the sheer dumbness of the plot -lrb- other than its one good idea -rrb- and the movie 's inescapable air of sleaziness get you down .
3 those who do n't entirely ` get ' godard 's distinctive discourse will still come away with a sense of his reserved but existential poignancy .
4 provides a very moving and revelatory footnote to the holocaust .
3 ... there is enough originality in ` life ' to distance it from the pack of paint-by-number romantic comedies that so often end up on cinema screens .
4 raimi crafted a complicated hero who is a welcome relief from the usual two-dimensional offerings .
1 if you saw benigni 's pinocchio at a public park , you 'd grab your kids and run and then probably call the police .
0 it is dark , brooding and slow , and takes its central idea way too seriously .
4 it cuts to the core of what it actually means to face your fears , to be a girl in a world of boys , to be a boy truly in love with a girl , and to ride the big metaphorical wave that is life -- wherever it takes you .
3 an enjoyable , if occasionally flawed , experiment .
4 it is , however , a completely honest , open-hearted film that should appeal to anyone willing to succumb to it .
1 i do n't think this movie loves women at all .
3 american musical comedy as we know it would n't exist without the precedent of yiddish theater , whose jolly , fun-for-fun 's - sake communal spirit goes to the essence of broadway .
3 do n't judge this one too soon - it 's a dark , gritty story but it takes off in totally unexpected directions and keeps on going .
3 ... -lrb- the film -rrb- works , due mostly to the tongue-in-cheek attitude of the screenplay .
0 features nonsensical and laughable plotting , wooden performances , ineptly directed action sequences and some of the worst dialogue in recent memory .
1 too smart to ignore but a little too smugly superior to like , this could be a movie that ends up slapping its target audience in the face by shooting itself in the foot .
2 it 's better than mid-range steven seagal , but not as sharp as jet li on rollerblades .
1 the director 's many dodges and turns add up to little more than a screenful of gamesmanship that 's low on both suspense and payoff .
2 or for the year , for that matter .
4 an invaluable historical document thanks to the filmmaker 's extraordinary access to massoud , whose charm , cultivation and devotion to his people are readily apparent .
0 ... no charm , no laughs , no fun , no reason to watch .
0 thanks largely to williams , all the interesting developments are processed in 60 minutes -- the rest is just an overexposed waste of film .
0 what might have emerged as hilarious lunacy in the hands of woody allen or mel brooks -lrb- at least during their '70s heyday -rrb- comes across as lame and sophomoric in this debut indie feature .
2 paul bettany playing malcolm mcdowell ?
2 that 's not vintage spielberg and that , finally , is minimally satisfying .
0 it would take a complete moron to foul up a screen adaptation of oscar wilde 's classic satire .
0 jackass is a vulgar and cheap-looking version of candid camera staged for the marquis de sade set .
3 everyone should be able to appreciate the wonderful cinematography and naturalistic acting .
2 another in a long line of ultra-violent war movies , this one is not quite what it could have been as a film , but the story and theme make up for it .
1 one well-timed explosion in a movie can be a knockout , but a hundred of them can be numbing .
1 where their heads were is anyone 's guess .
3 scotland looks wonderful , the fans are often funny fanatics , the showdown sure beats a bad day of golf .
4 the music makes a nice album , the food is enticing and italy beckons us all .
4 one of the best silly horror movies of recent memory , with some real shocks in store for unwary viewers .
3 the film is a very good viewing alternative for young women .
2 ` hey arnold ! '
4 beautifully shot against the frozen winter landscapes of grenoble and geneva , the film unfolds with all the mounting tension of an expert thriller , until the tragedy beneath it all gradually reveals itself .
4 griffin & co. manage to be spectacularly outrageous .
3 it is hard not to be especially grateful for freedom after a film like this .
3 a well-put-together piece of urban satire .
1 too much of nemesis has a tired , talky feel .
3 pan nalin 's exposition is beautiful and mysterious , and the interviews that follow , with the practitioners of this ancient indian practice , are as subtle and as enigmatic .
0 given the fact that virtually no one is bound to show up at theatres for it , the project should have been made for the tube .
1 with more character development this might have been an eerie thriller ; with better payoffs , it could have been a thinking man 's monster movie .
4 an entertaining british hybrid of comedy , caper thrills and quirky romance .
1 but ... in trying to capture the novel 's deeper intimate resonances , the film has -- ironically - distanced us from the characters .
4 the modern master of the chase sequence returns with a chase to end all chases
2 dense and thoughtful and brimming with ideas that are too complex to be rapidly absorbed .
1 queen of the damned as you might have guessed , makes sorry use of aaliyah in her one and only starring role -- she does little here but point at things that explode into flame .
0 a loud , witless mess that has none of the charm and little of the intrigue from the tv series .
1 a cartoon ?
2 if a few good men told us that we `` ca n't handle the truth '' than high crimes poetically states at one point in this movie that we `` do n't care about the truth . ''
0 a crass and insulting homage to great films like some like it hot and the john wayne classics .
1 the problem with `` xxx '' is that its own action is n't very effective .
3 ` yes , that 's right : it 's forrest gump , angel of death . '
1 with a romantic comedy plotline straight from the ages , this cinderella story does n't have a single surprise up its sleeve .
2 it 's lazy for a movie to avoid solving one problem by trying to distract us with the solution to another .
1 ... while certainly clever in spots , this too-long , spoofy update of shakespeare 's macbeth does n't sustain a high enough level of invention .
2 a sterling film - a cross between boys do n't cry , deliverance , and ode to billy joe - lies somewhere in the story of matthew shepard , but that film is yet to be made .
1 no new plot conceptions or environmental changes , just different bodies for sharp objects to rip through .
3 australian actor\/director john polson and award-winning english cinematographer giles nuttgens make a terrific effort at disguising the obvious with energy and innovation .
3 twohy knows how to inflate the mundane into the scarifying , and gets full mileage out of the rolling of a stray barrel or the unexpected blast of a phonograph record .
3 at once a testament to the divine calling of education and a demonstration of the painstaking process of imparting knowledge .
2 the film thrusts the inchoate but already eldritch christian right propaganda machine into national media circles .
1 insufferably naive .
1 these are textbook lives of quiet desperation .
3 worth a salute just for trying to be more complex than your average film .
2 spend your benjamins on a matinee .
3 it excels because , unlike so many other hollywood movies of its ilk , it offers hope .
4 the fun of the movie is the chance it affords to watch jackson , who also served as executive producer , take his smooth , shrewd , powerful act abroad .
0 far too clever by half , howard 's film is really a series of strung-together moments , with all the spaces in between filled with fantasies , daydreams , memories and one fantastic visual trope after another .
4 serious and thoughtful .
3 soderbergh skims the fat from the 1972 film .
4 a remarkably insightful look at the backstage angst of the stand-up comic .
3 alternately hilarious and sad , aggravating and soulful , scathing and joyous .
0 this is the case of a pregnant premise being wasted by a script that takes few chances and manages to insult the intelligence of everyone in the audience .
3 it 's unlikely we 'll see a better thriller this year .
2 ... manages to fall closer in quality to silence than to the abysmal hannibal .
1 it 's provocative stuff , but the speculative effort is hampered by taylor 's cartoonish performance and the film 's ill-considered notion that hitler 's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances .
1 a movie that ca n't get sufficient distance from leroy 's delusions to escape their maudlin influence .
1 though harris is affecting at times , he can not overcome the sense that pumpkin is a mere plot pawn for two directors with far less endearing disabilities .
1 schneidermeister ... makin ' a fool of himself ... losin ' his fan base ...
1 in this case zero .
1 the young stars are too cute ; the story and ensuing complications are too manipulative ; the message is too blatant ; the resolutions are too convenient .
3 the difference is that i truly enjoyed most of mostly martha while i ne
4 sexy and romantic .
0 by the time the plot grinds itself out in increasingly incoherent fashion , you might be wishing for a watch that makes time go faster rather than the other way around .
4 arteta directs one of the best ensemble casts of the year
2 culkin turns his character into what is basically an anti-harry potter -- right down to the gryffindor scarf .
4 vividly conveys the passion , creativity , and fearlessness of one of mexico 's most colorful and controversial artists -- a captivating drama that will speak to the nonconformist in us all .
3 the concept is a hoot .
3 it may not be particularly innovative , but the film 's crisp , unaffected style and air of gentle longing make it unexpectedly rewarding .
0 in its own way , joshua is as blasphemous and nonsensical as a luis buñuel film without the latter 's attendant intelligence , poetry , passion , and genius .
1 perhaps a better celebration of these unfairly dismissed heroes would be a film that is n't this painfully forced , false and fabricated .
0 ... you can be forgiven for realizing that you 've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for frida to just die already .
3 the director , mark pellington , does a terrific job conjuring up a sinister , menacing atmosphere though unfortunately all the story gives us is flashing red lights , a rattling noise , and a bump on the head .
4 even if the naipaul original remains the real masterpiece , the movie possesses its own languorous charm .
3 delivers more than its fair share of saucy hilarity .
2 but this is not a movie about an inhuman monster ; it 's about a very human one .
2 but his showboating wise-cracker stock persona sure is getting old .
0 if it were any more of a turkey , it would gobble in dolby digital stereo .
2 `` punch-drunk love '' is a little like a chocolate milk moustache ...
4 more intimate than spectacular , e.t. is carried less by wow factors than by its funny , moving yarn that holds up well after two decades .
4 i thought the relationships were wonderful , the comedy was funny , and the love ` real ' .
1 amid the shock and curiosity factors , the film is just a corny examination of a young actress trying to find her way .
4 wickedly funny , visually engrossing , never boring , this movie challenges us to think about the ways we consume pop culture .
2 the comedy makes social commentary more palatable .
3 the spaniel-eyed jean reno infuses hubert with a mixture of deadpan cool , wry humor and just the measure of tenderness required to give this comic slugfest some heart .
4 a film with almost as many delights for adults as there are for children and dog lovers .
0 a depraved , incoherent , instantly disposable piece of hackery .
2 while howard 's appreciation of brown and his writing is clearly well-meaning and sincere , the movie would be impossible to sit through were it not for the supporting cast .
0 the animation and game phenomenon that peaked about three years ago is actually dying a slow death , if the poor quality of pokemon 4 ever is any indication .
4 the camera soars above the globe in dazzling panoramic shots that make the most of the large-screen format , before swooping down on a string of exotic locales , scooping the whole world up in a joyous communal festival of rhythm .
1 what 's really sad is to see two academy award winning actresses -lrb- and one academy award winning actor -rrb- succumb to appearing in this junk that 's tv sitcom material at best .
1 -lrb- jackson and bledel -rrb- seem to have been picked not for their acting chops , but for their looks and appeal to the pre-teen crowd .
2 except as an acting exercise or an exceptionally dark joke , you wonder what anyone saw in this film that allowed it to get made .
1 whatever the movie 's sentimental , hypocritical lessons about sexism , its true colors come out in various wet t-shirt and shower scenes .
3 piercingly affecting ... while clearly a manipulative film , emerges as powerful rather than cloying .
1 gussied up with so many distracting special effects and visual party tricks that it 's not clear whether we 're supposed to shriek or laugh .
1 if only it had the story to match .
3 `` frailty '' has been written so well , that even a simple `` goddammit ! ''
3 the pianist is the film roman polanski may have been born to make .
3 the film has an infectious enthusiasm and we 're touched by the film 's conviction that all life centered on that place , that time and that sport .
4 an excellent sequel .
1 the trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , a victim of mental illness .
4 it 's a technically superb film , shining with all the usual spielberg flair , expertly utilizing the talents of his top-notch creative team .
2 in gleefully , thumpingly hyperbolic terms , it covers just about every cliche in the compendium about crass , jaded movie types and the phony baloney movie biz .
1 the story really has no place to go since simone is not real -- she ca n't provide any conflict .
3 both a detective story and a romance spiced with the intrigue of academic skullduggery and politics .
1 all the sensuality , all the eroticism of a good vampire tale has been , pardon the pun , sucked out and replaced by goth goofiness .
3 a quiet , disquieting triumph .
3 anyone who ever fantasized about space travel but ca n't afford the $ 20 million ticket to ride a russian rocket should catch this imax offering .
0 -lrb- carvey 's -rrb- characters are both overplayed and exaggerated , but then again , subtlety has never been his trademark .
1 if divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood suffers from a ploddingly melodramatic structure , it comes to life in the performances .
0 rashomon-for-dipsticks tale .
3 sleek and arty .
3 a terrific date movie , whatever your orientation .
3 the exploitative , clumsily staged violence overshadows everything , including most of the actors .
2 there are moments of real pleasure to be found in sara sugarman 's whimsical comedy very annie-mary but not enough to sustain the film .
1 it takes a really long , slow and dreary time to dope out what tuck everlasting is about .
0 it 's splash without the jokes .
3 even as it pays earnest homage to turntablists and beat jugglers , old schoolers and current innovators , scratch is great fun , full of the kind of energy it 's documenting .
2 while kids will probably eat the whole thing up , most adults will be way ahead of the plot .
0 you begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain .
4 a coming-of-age movie that hollywood would n't have the guts to make .
3 ` possession , ' based on the book by a.s. byatt , demands that labute deal with the subject of love head-on ; trading in his cynicism for reverence and a little wit
1 did no one on the set have a sense of humor , or did they not have the nerve to speak up ?
1 cinematic pyrotechnics aside , the only thing avary seems to care about are mean giggles and pulchritude .
3 some of the most inventive silliness you are likely to witness in a movie theatre for some time .
0 the story is lacking any real emotional impact , and the plot is both contrived and cliched .
4 others , more attuned to the anarchist maxim that ` the urge to destroy is also a creative urge ' , or more willing to see with their own eyes , will find morrison 's iconoclastic uses of technology to be liberating .
3 an awfully good , achingly human picture .
1 but no. .
2 the main problem being that it 's only a peek .
2 slow , silly and unintentionally hilarious .
1 it never plays as dramatic even when dramatic things happen to people .
1 i have n't seen such self-amused trash since freddy got fingered .
1 a cross between blow and boyz n the hood , this movie strives to be more , but does n't quite get there .
2 ... a visually seductive , unrepentantly trashy take on rice 's second installment of her vampire chronicles .
2 `` what really happened ? ''
0 it 's a bad action movie because there 's no rooting interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring .
4 provides the kind of ` laugh therapy ' i need from movie comedies -- offbeat humor , amusing characters , and a happy ending .
1 a prolonged extrusion of psychopathic pulp .
1 little action , almost no suspense or believable tension , one-dimensional characters up the wazoo and sets that can only be described as sci-fi generic .
4 director nancy savoca 's no-frills record of a show forged in still-raw emotions captures the unsettled tenor of that post 9-11 period far better than a more measured or polished production ever could .
4 despite its floating narrative , this is a remarkably accessible and haunting film .
0 the sum of all fears pretends to be a serious exploration of nuclear terrorism , but it 's really nothing more than warmed-over cold war paranoia .
3 the hypnotic imagery and fragmentary tale explore the connections between place and personal identity .
3 it 's fun , splashy and entertainingly nasty .
2 big time .
4 ... the first 2\/3 of the film are incredibly captivating and insanely funny , thanks in part to interesting cinematic devices -lrb- cool visual backmasking -rrb- , a solid cast , and some wickedly sick and twisted humor ...
0 rather , pity anyone who sees this mishmash .
3 return to never land may be another shameless attempt by disney to rake in dough from baby boomer families , but it 's not half-bad .
3 the movie , despite its rough edges and a tendency to sag in certain places , is wry and engrossing .
1 much like robin williams , death to smoochy has already reached its expiration date .
3 a pleasing , often-funny comedy .
3 a tour de force drama about the astonishingly pivotal role of imagination in the soulful development of two rowdy teenagers .
3 good actors have a radar for juicy roles -- there 's a plethora of characters in this picture , and not one of them is flat .
1 after all , it 'll probably be in video stores by christmas , and it might just be better suited to a night in the living room than a night at the movies .
1 it concentrates far too much on the awkward interplay and utter lack of chemistry between chan and hewitt .
3 her performance moves between heartbreak and rebellion as she continually tries to accommodate to fit in and gain the unconditional love she seeks .
2 has an uppity musical beat that you can dance to , but its energy ca n't compare to the wit , humor and snappy dialogue of the original .
2 that is because - damn it !
1 bad company .
4 so vivid a portrait of a woman consumed by lust and love and crushed by betrayal that it conjures up the intoxicating fumes and emotional ghosts of a freshly painted rembrandt .
3 if you 've grown tired of going where no man has gone before , but several movies have - take heart .
2 unintelligible , poorly acted , brain-slappingly bad , harvard man is ludicrous enough that it could become a cult classic .

2 dodgy mixture of cutesy romance , dark satire and murder mystery .
3 almost everyone growing up believes their family must look like `` the addams family '' to everyone looking in ... `` my big fat greek wedding '' comes from the heart ...
1 an excruciating demonstration of the unsalvageability of a movie saddled with an amateurish screenplay .
3 despite its old-hat set-up and predictable plot , empire still has enough moments to keep it entertaining .
1 otherwise , this could be a passable date film .
3 -lrb- at least -rrb- moore is a real charmer .
1 leaves viewers out in the cold and undermines some phenomenal performances .
3 this rush to profits has created a predictably efficient piece of business notable largely for its overwhelming creepiness , for an eagerness to create images you wish you had n't seen , which , in this day and age , is of course the point .
2 as warren he stumbles in search of all the emotions and life experiences he 's neglected over the years .
3 the concept behind kung pow : enter the fist is hilarious .
2 bang !
3 by not averting his eyes , solondz forces us to consider the unthinkable , the unacceptable , the unmentionable .
1 ... better described as a ghost story gone badly awry .
1 the movie itself appears to be running on hypertime in reverse as the truly funny bits get further and further apart .
1 does n't get the job done , running off the limited chemistry created by ralph fiennes and jennifer lopez .

0 rarely has sex on screen been so aggressively anti-erotic .
3 straightforward and old-fashioned in the best possible senses of both those words , possession is a movie that puts itself squarely in the service of the lovers who inhabit it .

2 die another day is only intermittently entertaining but it 's hard not to be a sucker for its charms , or perhaps it 's just impossible not to feel nostalgia for movies you grew up with .
3 it works well enough , since the thrills pop up frequently , and the dispatching of the cast is as often imaginative as it is gory .
4 -lrb- hayek -rrb- throws herself into this dream hispanic role with a teeth-clenching gusto , she strikes a potent chemistry with molina and she gradually makes us believe she is kahlo .
1 the film 's needlessly opaque intro takes its doe-eyed crudup out of pre-9 \/ 11 new york and onto a cross-country road trip of the homeric kind .

2 entertaining despite its one-joke premise with the thesis that women from venus and men from mars can indeed get together .
3 despite besson 's high-profile name being wasabi 's big selling point , there is no doubt that krawczyk deserves a huge amount of the credit for the film 's thoroughly winning tone .

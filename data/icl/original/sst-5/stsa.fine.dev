1 at least one scene is so disgusting that viewers may be hard pressed to retain their lunch .
4 the movie has an infectious exuberance that will engage anyone with a passing interest in the skate\/surf culture , the l.a. beach scene and the imaginative -lrb- and sometimes illegal -rrb- ways kids can make a playground out of the refuse of adults .
2 should be seen at the very least for its spasms of absurdist humor .

1 villeneuve spends too much time wallowing in bibi 's generic angst -lrb- there are a lot of shots of her gazing out windows -rrb- .
0 what is 100 % missing here is a script of even the most elemental literacy , an inkling of genuine wit , and anything resembling acting .

1 ... nothing scary here except for some awful acting and lame special effects .
1 it made me want to wrench my eyes out of my head and toss them at the screen .

2 a delirious celebration of the female orgasm .
3 reign of fire looks as if it was made without much thought -- and is best watched that way .
2 without the dark spookiness of crystal lake camp , the horror concept completely loses its creepy menace .
4 the acting , costumes , music , cinematography and sound are all astounding given the production 's austere locales .
1 this is n't even madonna 's swept away .
2 i ca n't quite recommend it -- it 's too patched together -- but i almost can ; it 's the kind of movie that makes you want to like it .
4 a coda in every sense , the pinochet case splits time between a minute-by-minute account of the british court 's extradition chess game and the regime 's talking-head survivors .
4 brilliantly explores the conflict between following one 's heart and following the demands of tradition .
0 like you could n't smell this turkey rotting from miles away .

3 a movie that reminds us of just how exciting and satisfying the fantasy cinema can be when it 's approached with imagination and flair .
3 but it still jingles in the pocket .
4 it 's the chemistry between the women and the droll scene-stealing wit and wolfish pessimism of anna chancellor that makes this `` two weddings and a funeral '' fun .
0 it all drags on so interminably it 's like watching a miserable relationship unfold in real time .
2 the french are rather good at this kind of thing , unlike the americans , who have a passion for musketeers , only to spoof them .

4 you do n't have to know about music to appreciate the film 's easygoing blend of comedy and romance .
2 if you 're a wwf fan , or you related to the people who watched the robots getting butchered in a.i. , you 'll probably like rollerball .
1 the film makes a fatal mistake : it asks us to care about a young man whose only apparent virtue is that he is not quite as unpleasant as some of the people in his life .

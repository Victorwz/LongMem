2 just how extreme are these ops ?
2 too leisurely paced and visually drab for its own good , it succeeds in being only sporadically amusing .

2 just one problem : fish out of water usually die .
2 some actors steal scenes .
4 this warm and gentle romantic comedy has enough interesting characters to fill several movies , and its ample charms should win over the most hard-hearted cynics .
1 half of it is composed of snappy patter and pseudo-sophisticated cultural observations , while the remainder ... would be more at home on a daytime television serial .
1 though howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this southern gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter .
3 a tough go , but leigh 's depth and rigor , and his skill at inspiring accomplished portrayals that are all the more impressive for their lack of showiness , offsets to a notable degree the film 's often-mined and despairing milieu .

0 matthew mcconaughey tries , and fails , to control the screen with swaggering machismo and over-the-top lunacy .
1 a predictable and stereotypical little b-movie .
2 a morality tale whose thought-provoking potential is hampered by a made-for-tv look , rigid performances and an asinine ` twist ' that brazenly rips off the sixth sense .
1 i 'm not suggesting that you actually see it , unless you 're the kind of person who has seen every wim wenders film of the '70s .

2 admirable , certainly , but not much fun to watch .
2 `` the emperor 's new clothes '' begins with a simple plan ... well , at least that 's the plan .
4 often gruelling and heartbreaking to witness , but seldahl and wollter 's sterling performances raise this far above the level of the usual maudlin disease movie .

2 i have n't seen one in so long , no wonder i did n't recognize it at first .
1 as tweedy talks about canning his stockbroker and repairing his pool , you yearn for a few airborne tv sets or nude groupies on the nod to liven things up .
4 cedar takes a very open-minded approach to this sensitive material , showing impressive control , both visually and in the writing .
1 you can practically smell the patchouli oil .
4 cute , funny , heartwarming digitally animated feature film with plenty of slapstick humor for the kids , lots of in-jokes for the adults and heart enough for everyone .
3 what full frontal lacks in thematic coherence it largely makes up for as loosey-goosey , experimental entertainment .
2 this 72-minute film does have some exciting scenes , but it 's a tad slow .

1 mark me down as a non-believer in werewolf films that are not serious and rely on stupidity as a substitute for humor .
3 maguire is a surprisingly effective peter\/spider-man .
3 windtalkers is shapelessly gratifying , the kind of movie that invites you to pick apart its faults even as you have to admit that somehow it hit you where you live .
4 for its seriousness , high literary aspirations and stunning acting , the film can only be applauded .

4 it 's rare to find a film that dazzles the eye , challenges the brain , and satisfies our lust for fast-paced action , but minority report delivers all that and a whole lot more .
4 a charming , quirky and leisurely paced scottish comedy -- except with an outrageous central gimmick that could have been a reject from monty python 's meaning of life .
4 a graceful , contemplative film that gradually and artfully draws us into a world where the personal and the political get fatally intertwined .
0 what will , most likely , turn out to be the most repellent movie of 2002 .
1 a little too pat for its own good .
1 the story is familiar from its many predecessors ; like them , it eventually culminates in the not-exactly - stunning insight that crime does n't pay .
1 even legends like alfred hitchcock and john huston occasionally directed trifles ... so it 's no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like zhang yimou behind the camera for a yarn that 's ultimately rather inconsequential .
3 if nothing else , this movie introduces a promising , unusual kind of psychological horror .
0 a sermonizing and lifeless paean to teenage dullards .
1 for all its highfalutin title and corkscrew narrative , the movie turns out to be not much more than a shaggy human tale .
0 had anyone here done anything remotely intelligent , we all could have stopped watching long ago .
3 a teasing drama whose relentless good-deed\/bad-deed reversals are just interesting enough to make a sinner like me pray for an even more interesting , less symmetrical , less obviously cross-shaped creation .
0 there is not a character in the movie with a shred of plausibility , not an event that is believable , not a confrontation that is not staged , not a moment that is not false .
0 bad company leaves a bad taste , not only because of its bad-luck timing , but also the staleness of its script .

3 an unbelievably fun film just a leading man away from perfection .
0 extremely dumb .
2 in the end , ted bundy 's only justification is the director 's common but unexplored fascination with the frustrated maniac ; there 's no larger point , and little social context .
1 flotsam in the sea of moviemaking , not big enough for us to worry about it causing significant harm and not smelly enough to bother despising .
2 just what makes us happy , anyway ?
1 cliches are as thick as the cigarette smoke .
2 just like the deli sandwich : lots of ham , lots of cheese , with a sickly sweet coating to disguise its excrescence until just after -lrb- or during -rrb- consumption of its second half .

0 leave these flowers unpicked -- they 're dead on the vine .
1 when the plot kicks in , the film loses credibility .

2 morton is a great actress portraying a complex character , but morvern callar grows less compelling the farther it meanders from its shocking start .
2 all prints of this film should be sent to and buried on pluto .
0 the unceasing sadism is so graphically excessive , the director just ends up exposing his own obsession .
2 it 's a worse sign when you begin to envy her condition .
1 imagine the james woods character from videodrome making a home movie of audrey rose and showing it to the kid from the sixth sense and you 've imagined the ring .
1 this film was made to get laughs from the slowest person in the audience -- just pure slapstick with lots of inane , inoffensive screaming and exaggerated facial expressions .
1 it 's so underwritten that you ca n't figure out just where the other characters , including ana 's father and grandfather , come down on the issue of ana 's future .
4 think of it as a sort of comfort food for the mind .
4 hilarious , acidic brit comedy .
3 an incredibly clever and superbly paced caper filled with scams within scams within scams .
1 myers never knows when to let a gag die ; thus , we 're subjected to one mind-numbingly lengthy riff on poo and pee jokes after another .
4 but watching huppert , a great actress tearing into a landmark role , is riveting .
4 a marvellous journey from childhood idealism to adolescent self-absorption .
4 whether seen on a 10-inch television screen or at your local multiplex , the edge-of-your-seat , educational antics of steve irwin are priceless entertainment .
0 how did it ever get made ?
3 it is also , at times , curiously moving .
4 it is inspirational in characterizing how people from such diverse cultures share the same human and spiritual needs .
4 a candid and often fascinating documentary about a pentecostal church in dallas that assembles an elaborate haunted house each year to scare teenagers into attending services .
2 the film provides some great insight into the neurotic mindset of all comics -- even those who have reached the absolute top of the game .
3 the invincible werner herzog is alive and well and living in la
2 the additional storyline is interesting and entertaining , but it does n't have the same magical quality as the beginning of the story .

1 as an actor , the rock is aptly named .
4 thoughtful , provocative and entertaining .
1 scene-by-scene , things happen , but you 'd be hard-pressed to say what or why .
1 at nearly three hours , the whole of safe conduct is less than the sum of its parts .
1 dawdles and drags when it should pop ; it does n't even have the virtue of enough mindless violence to break up the tedium of all its generational bonding .
1 places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting , and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller .
2 the recording session is the only part of the film that is enlightening -- and how appreciative you are of this depends on your level of fandom .
0 trivial where it should be profound , and hyper-cliched where it should be sincere .
3 there 's not much more to this adaptation of the nick hornby novel than charm -- effortless , pleasurable , featherweight charm .
1 good for a few unintentional laughs , `` extreme ops '' was obviously made for the `` xxx '' crowd , people who enjoy mindless action without the benefit of decent acting , writing , and direction .

1 notorious c.h.o. has oodles of vulgar highlights .
1 before long , the film starts playing like general hospital crossed with a saturday night live spoof of dog day afternoon .
1 it 's just a silly black genre spoof .
0 as written by michael berg and michael j. wilson from a story by wilson , this relentless , all-wise-guys-all-the-time approach tries way too hard and gets tiring in no time at all .
3 in fessenden 's horror trilogy , this theme has proved important to him and is especially so in the finale .
0 splashes its drama all over the screen , subjecting its audience and characters to action that feels not only manufactured , but also so false you can see the filmmakers ' puppet strings .
4 offers that rare combination of entertainment and education .
4 romanek keeps the film constantly taut ... reflecting the character 's instability with a metaphorical visual style and an unnerving , heartbeat-like score .
3 despite the long running time , the pace never feels slack -- there 's no scene that screams `` bathroom break ! ''
4 greene delivers a typically solid performance in a role that is a bit of a departure from the noble characters he has played in the past , and he is matched by schweig , who carries the film on his broad , handsome shoulders .
2 the heightened symmetry of this new\/old cinema paradiso makes the film a fuller experience , like an old friend haunted by the exigencies of time .
4 moore 's complex and important film is also , believe it or not , immensely entertaining , a david and goliath story that 's still very much playing itself out .
1 there 's no denying the elaborateness of the artist 's conceptions , nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan , but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense , lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity .
2 hip-hop has a history , and it 's a metaphor for this love story .
4 as a belated nod to some neglected all-stars , standing in the shadows of motown is cultural history of the best kind : informative , revealing and richly entertaining .
4 engagingly captures the maddening and magnetic ebb and flow of friendship .
3 eventually , it wins you over .
4 you 'll be left with the sensation of having just witnessed a great performance and , perhaps , give in to the urge to get on your feet and shake it .
2 effective but too-tepid biopic
1 if we do n't demand a standard of quality for the art that we choose , we deserve the trash that we get .
4 the acting alone is worth the price of admission .
4 i admired this work a lot .
1 might have been better off as a documentary , with less of mr. eyre 's uninspired dramatics and more of his sense of observation and outrage .
1 it tries too hard , and overreaches the logic of its own world .
2 the final result makes for adequate entertainment , i suppose , but anyone who has seen chicago on stage will leave the theater feeling they 've watched nothing but a pale imitation of the real deal .
3 highlights are the terrific performances by christopher plummer , as the prime villain , and nathan lane as vincent crummles , the eccentric theater company manager .
3 bullock does a good job here of working against her natural likability .
4 the 3d images only enhance the film 's otherworldly quality , giving it a strange combo of you-are-there closeness with the disorienting unreality of the seemingly broken-down fourth wall of the movie screen .
3 this version 's no classic like its predecessor , but its pleasures are still plentiful .
0 it 's neither as romantic nor as thrilling as it should be .
0 if this is the danish idea of a good time , prospective tourists might want to consider a different destination -- some jolly country embroiled in a bloody civil war , perhaps .
3 but some unexpected zigs and zags help .
3 we can see the wheels turning , and we might resent it sometimes , but this is still a nice little picture , made by bright and friendly souls with a lot of good cheer .
3 it is not a mass-market entertainment but an uncompromising attempt by one artist to think about another .
4 an irresistible combination of a rousing good story set on a truly grand scale .
3 de niro and mcdormand give solid performances , but their screen time is sabotaged by the story 's inability to create interest .
0 the master of disaster - it 's a piece of dreck disguised as comedy .
4 as weber and weissman demonstrate with such insight and celebratory verve , the cockettes were n't as much about gender , sexual preference or political agitprop as they were simply a triumph of the indomitable human will to rebel , connect and create .
2 the attempt is courageous , even if the result is wildly uneven .
4 a psychological thriller with a smart script and an obsessive-compulsive 's attention to detail .
3 interacting eyeball-to-eyeball and toe-to-toe , hopkins and norton are a winning combination -- but fiennes steals ` red dragon ' right from under their noses .
1 what could and should have been biting and droll is instead a tepid waste of time and talent .

2 brimful .
1 it virtually defines a comedy that 's strongly mediocre , with funny bits surfacing every once in a while .
4 the film benefits greatly from a less manic tone than its predecessor , as cho appears to have settled comfortably into her skin .
3 fans of nijinsky will savor every minute of cox 's work .
2 viewed on its own terms , treasure planet is better-than-average family entertainment , but true fans of the stevenson 's novel will likely prefer disney 's more faithful 1950 live-action swashbuckling classic .
4 novak manages to capture a cruelly hilarious vein of black comedy in the situation with his cast of non-actors and a gritty , no-budget approach .
3 what really surprises about wisegirls is its low-key quality and genuine tenderness .
4 i enjoyed the ride -lrb- bumps and all -rrb- , creamy depth , and ultimate theme .

0 the film is like a series of beginnings and middles that never take off .
1 verbinski substitutes atmosphere for action , tedium for thrills .

1 the charms of willful eccentricity , at least as evidenced by this latest cinematic essay , are beginning to wear a bit thin .
1 though everything might be literate and smart , it never took off and always seemed static .
1 we miss the quirky amazement that used to come along for an integral part of the ride .
4 complex , affecting and uniquely almodóvar , the film evokes strong emotions and pushes viewers to question their deepest notions of moral right and wrong .
2 maybe it 's just because this past year has seen the release of some of the worst film comedies in decades ... but honestly , analyze that really is n't all that bad .
2 the reason i found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say , is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory .
4 a savvy exploration of paranoia and insecurity in america 's culture of fear .

1 its mysteries are transparently obvious , and it 's too slowly paced to be a thriller .
1 its gross-out gags and colorful set pieces ... are of course stultifyingly contrived and too stylized by half .
4 there is a refreshing absence of cynicism in stuart little 2 -- quite a rarity , even in the family film market .
1 creepy but ultimately unsatisfying thriller .
4 without resorting to hyperbole , i can state that kissing jessica stein may be the best same-sex romance i have seen .
4 a sensitive and expertly acted crowd-pleaser that is n't above a little broad comedy and a few unabashedly sentimental tears .
3 the experience of watching blobby old-school cgi animation in this superlarge format is just surreal enough to be diverting .
0 ... too slow , too boring , and occasionally annoying .
1 this is pretty dicey material .
1 the premise is overshadowed by the uberviolence of the clericks as this becomes just another kung-fu sci-fi movie with silly action sequences .
2 as is most commonly case with projects such noble and lofty ambitions , the film is less poetic than simply pretentious .
3 subversive , meditative , clinical and poetic , the piano teacher is a daring work of genius .
3 -lrb- a -rrb- hollywood sheen bedevils the film from the very beginning ... -lrb- but -rrb- lohman 's moist , deeply emotional eyes shine through this bogus veneer ...
1 it does n't do the original any particular dishonor , but neither does it exude any charm or personality .
2 beers , who , when she 's given the right lines , can charm the paint off the wall ... -lrb- but -rrb- the script goes wrong at several key junctures .
4 ... blade ii is more enjoyable than the original .
1 there 's suspension of disbelief and then there 's bad screenwriting ... this film packs a wallop of the latter .
1 an often-deadly boring , strange reading of a classic whose witty dialogue is treated with a baffling casual approach
1 the problem with concept films is that if the concept is a poor one , there 's no saving the movie .
1 safe conduct , however ambitious and well-intentioned , fails to hit the entertainment bull 's - eye .
1 a film made with as little wit , interest , and professionalism as artistically possible for a slummy hollywood caper flick .
2 to enjoy this movie 's sharp dialogue and delightful performance by jolie and burns , you have to gloss over the no sense ending .
0 but here 's the real damn : it is n't funny , either .
